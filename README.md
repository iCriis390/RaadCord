🌐 **Languages / Lingue:** [English](README.md) | [Italiano](README_IT.md)

RaadCord is a fork of [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord) & [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), with over 300+ plugins.
An open‑source client built for those who believe in absolute freedom of development.
I created this client for myself, but little by little, other people started to like my ideas and features, and it became more popular.
This Discord client aims to provide more private communication thanks to the "SecurecordOpossum" plugin
and allows you to bypass upload limits using external services such as anon.li
If you're looking for a Discord client designed to offer greater privacy for what you can do, you've come to the right place.
This client also has a plugin for setting up stereo audio on Discord and offers better audio quality than Lightcord, without any hidden fees or closed-source software. We are completely open source.

## Installing RaadCord

### Dependencies

Installer : https://github.com/iCriis390/RaadCordInstaller

[Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and [Node.JS LTS](https://nodejs.dev/en/) are required.

Install `pnpm`:

> :exclamation: This next command may need to be run as admin/root depending on your system, and you may need to close and reopen your terminal for pnpm to be in your PATH.

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```

> :exclamation: **IMPORTANT** Make sure you aren't using an admin/root terminal from here onwards. It **will** mess up your Discord/RaadCord instance and you **will** most likely have to reinstall.

Clone RaadCord:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iCriis390/RaadCord
cd RaadCord
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

pnpm build
```

Inject RaadCord into your desktop client:

```shell
pnpm inject
```

Build RaadCord for web:

```shell
pnpm buildWeb
```

After building RaadCord's web extension, locate the appropriate ZIP file in the `dist` directory and follow your browser’s guide for installing custom extensions, if supported.

Note: Firefox extension zip requires Firefox for developers

<summary>Using RaadCord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine if you don’t use plugins that implement abusive behaviour.

Regardless, if your account is essential to you and getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Equicord / RaadCord), just to be safe.

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with RaadCord in a server where you might get banned for it.
